Hey, my name is Jarek and I am here because of my love for data science!

BACKGROUND
I graduated high school math-and-science class, so when I decided to study philosophy rather than e.g. engineering, some considered it a ridiculous idea. Yet I had a clear vision for myself and followed it by gaining knowledge in fields of analytics, logic, heuristics and systems thinking. The ability to make sense of the complexity of things by seeking relationships between them, helped me to discover a passion for working with data and numbers. Using my experience in business analysis (I am a certified accountant with a Master's degree in Business Management), I am currently getting into the world of data science and machine learning!

WHAT I AM CURRENTLY LEARNING?
I am studing Machine Learning & Data Science. Most of my free time is occupied by working with Python, SQL and different data visualizations tools like Power BI.
