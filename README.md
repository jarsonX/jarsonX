Hey, my name is Jarek and I am here because of my love for data science!


BACKGROUND

I graduated high school math-and-science class, so when I decided to study philosophy rather than e.g. engineering, some considered it a ridiculous idea. Yet I had a clear vision for myself and followed it by gaining knowledge in fields of analytics, logic, heuristics and systems thinking. The ability to make sense of the complexity of things by seeking relationships between them, helped me to discover a passion for working with data and numbers. Apart from being, well, a philosopher (just look at my beard), I am also a certified accountant and a Master of Business Management. Using my experience in financial analysis, I'm currently getting into the world of data science and machine learning!


WHAT I AM CURRENTLY LEARNING?

I am studing Machine Learning & Data Science. Most of my free time is occupied by mastering Python, SQL, data visualization and math skills. Sadly, I am an incurable case of someone who needs to know WHY it works, not only HOW (it really gives me headaches sometimes). That's why I also like to read about computing in general and algorithmics - a recommendation of a good book, video, course etc. related to those topics is always welcome!
