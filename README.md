Hey, my name is Jarek and generally speaking, I'm one of these guys that come up with an idea on how to solve a programming problem in the middle of the night or under the shower, and need to check it out immediately.


BACKGROUND

I graduated high school math-and-science class, so when I decided to study philosophy rather than e.g. engineering, some considered it a ridiculous idea. Yet I had a clear vision for myself and followed it by gaining knowledge in fields of analysis, logic, heuristics and systems thinking (tip: having a beard or at least liking beards is recommended to study anything related to philosophy). The ability to make sense of the complexity of things by seeking relationships between them, helped me to discover a passion for working with data and numbers. Apart from being, well, a philosopher (which oblige me to have a beard, obviously), I am also a certified accountant and a Master of Corporate Management. Using my experience in business/financial analysis, I'm currently getting into the world of data science and machine learning!


WHAT I AM CURRENTLY LEARNING?

I am an aspiring professional data analyst, studing Machine Learning & Data Science at university. Most of my free time is occupied by mastering Python, SQL, data visualization and math skills. Sadly, I am an incurable case of someone who needs to know WHY it works, not only HOW (it really gives me headaches sometimes, so please don't get me started on deep learning). That's why I also like to read about computing in general and algorithmics - a recommendation of a good book, video, course etc. related to those topics is always welcome!
