My name is Jarek and I am a Business Intelligence Developer.

Primary technologies that I use: Microsoft Power Platform, SQL (T-SQL), VBA and Python.

My strength lies in well-rounded education, combining technical and soft skills. I graduated high school with an advanced mathematics profile, earned a master's degree in corporate management, a bachelor's degree in philosophy, and further expanded my education with certificates and postgraduate studies in financial accounting, data analysis and visualization, programming, and data science. I continue to actively develop these competencies.
