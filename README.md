I am an analyst and developer specializing in Business Intelligence and Data Science, with experience working in international environments and collaborating closely with business stakeholders.

My background combines a strong analytical foundation with a broad, interdisciplinary education. I completed secondary education with an advanced mathematics profile, earned a master’s degree in corporate management and a bachelor’s degree in philosophy, and further expanded my skill set through postgraduate studies and professional certifications in financial accounting, data analysis and visualization, programming, and data science. I continue to actively develop these competencies.

In my day-to-day work, I primarily use Microsoft Power Platform, SQL (T-SQL, PL/SQL), and Python. Earlier in my career, I worked extensively with VBA, which strengthened my approach to automation and data-driven problem solving.
