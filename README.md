Hey, my name is Jarek and data science is my passion.

I graduated high school math-and-science class, so when I decided to study philosophy rather than e.g. engineering, some considered it a ridiculous idea. Yet I had a clear vision for myself and followed it by gaining knowledge in fields of analysis, logic and systems thinking (tip: having a beard or at least liking beards is recommended to study anything related to philosophy). The ability to make sense of the complexity of things by seeking relationships between them, helped me to discover a passion for working with data and numbers. Apart from being, well, a philosopher (which oblige me to have a beard, obviously), I am also an IBM Certified Data Analyst, certified accountant and a Master of Corporate Management. 

I'm currently studing Machine Learning and Data Science at the universtiy.
