My name is Jarek and data is my passion.

I have experience working with advanced MS Excel, MS Power BI, SQL (mostly MS SQL Server/T-SQL, Snowflake/ANSI-SQL), VBA and Python.

My strength lies in well-rounded education, combining technical and soft skills. I graduated high school with an advanced mathematics profile, earned a master's degree in corporate management, a bachelor's degree in philosophy, and further expanded my education with certificates and postgraduate studies in financial accounting, data analysis and visualization, programming, and data science. I continue to actively develop these competencies.

I'm currently engaged in process reengineering and data reporting projects.
